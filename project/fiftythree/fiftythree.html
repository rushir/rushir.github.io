			The summer of 2014, before the start of my senior year in high school, I had the wonderful oppurtunity to visit the Seattle headquarters of <a href="http://www.fiftythree.com">FiftyThree</a> and do a job shadow over the course of one week.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			I had been applying to as many internship programs as I could but unfortunatley I had started to late. However when one of FiftyThree's engineers started following me on Twitter and said they liked my work, the least I could do was ask "if not an internship, how about a job shadow?". And so it happened. Over the next several weeks we worked out schedules and had a Google Hangout or two just to get a feel of what the environment would be like and who I'd be working with. 
			</p>

			<p>
			The following is a documentation of what I did every day along with things I learned.
			</p>

			<h3>Day 1</h3>

			<p>The first day was mainly about getting set up with all the tools I'd be using, getting the various libraries and code bases onto my computer, and just getting used to the office. Learning to use Git was highly encouraged and was one of the big things I accomplished while I was here. I was also introduced to a variety of other tools like <a href="http://hipchat.com">HipChat</a>, <a href="http://neo4j.com">neo4j</a>, and of course Sublime Text and Sketch. A lot of my work ended up being centered around creating a styleguide so I also worked with <a href="https://github.com/tj/nib">nib</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kneath/kss">kss</a>.</p>

			<h3>Day 2</h3>

			<p>The second day started off with a meeting with one of the team's in New York that was working on the same project we were, the frontend of <a href="https://mix.fiftythree.com">Mix</a>. Throughout the day I made myself more familiar with the codebase and the goals we were trying to accomplish. It was here that I decided that maybe I shouldn't be delving into the development so much, and should do something more design related. Daniel suggested I work on the styleguide for Mix, so he helped me get setup with that and I was good to go!</p>

			<h3>Day 3</h3>

			<h3>Day 4</h3>

			<h3>Day 5</h3>	
			<p>The last day was about wrapping up for the week. It consisted of a big meeting between the entire team in the Seattle office and the entire team in the New York office. Everyone was given a chance to present what they had been working on that week (even me! though I didn't take the oppurutnity). This was especially cool because I was introduced to the other cofounders on the east coast and see people like <a href="https://twitter.com/kjchun">KJ</a> who had helped me on my path.</p>

			<h3>Shout Outs</h3>
			<p>I want to give a shout out to <a href="https://twitter.com/gasi">Daniel Gasienica</a> who was my mentor for the duration I was there. He's the one that helped me get all setup and explained really complex algorithm related questions in a way that I could understand. I also want to give a huge shout out to <a href="https://twitter.com/johnikeda">John Ikeda</a> who helped me understand the differences in the various forms of design, from industrial, to product, to visual, and how I should go about finding my passion. I also want to mention <a href="https://twitter.com/jon_creates">Jon Harris</a>, one of the co-founders of FiftyThree, who helped me understand what goes into a good design portfolio and how to tell the narrative of the design process. And lastly I also want to give a shout out to <a href="https://twitter.com/tfeener">Tara Feener</a> for first noticing me and giving me that follow that started the whole ball rolling. If it weren't for her none of this would've been able to happen.</p>
