			The summer of 2014, before the start of my senior year in high school, I had the wonderful oppurtunity to visit the Seattle headquarters of <a href="http://www.fiftythree.com">FiftyThree</a> and do a job shadow over the course of one week.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			I had been applying to as many internship programs as I could but unfortunatley I had started to late. However when one of FiftyThree's engineers started following me on Twitter and said they liked my work, the least I could do was ask "if not an internship, how about a job shadow?". And so it happened. Over the next several weeks we worked out schedules and had a Google Hangout or two just to get a feel of what the environment would be like and who I'd be working with. 
			</p>

			<p>
			The following is a documentation of what I did every day along with things I learned.
			</p>

			<h3>Day 1</h3>

			<p>The first day was mainly about getting set up with all the tools I'd be using, getting the various libraries and code bases onto my computer, and just getting used to the office. Learning to use Git was highly encouraged and was one of the big things I accomplished while I was here. I was also introduced to a variety of other tools like <a href="http://hipchat.com">HipChat</a>, <a href="http://neo4j.com">neo4j</a>, and of course Sublime Text and Sketch. A lot of my work ended up being centered around creating a styleguide so I also worked with <a href="https://github.com/tj/nib">nib</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kneath/kss">kss</a>.</p>

			<h3>Day 2</h3>

			<p>The second day started off with a meeting with one of the team's in New York that was working on the same project we were, the frontend of <a href="https://mix.fiftythree.com">Mix</a>. Throughout the day I made myself more familiar with the codebase and the goals we were trying to accomplish. It was here that I decided that maybe I shouldn't be delving into the development so much, and should do something more design related. Daniel suggested I work on the styleguide for Mix, so he helped me get setup with that and I was good to go!</p>
			
			<img class="bodyimg" src="/resources/img/projects/fiftythree/catan.jpg" alt="" align="middle"><p></p>
			<p>Later that day we had Chinese takeout and stuck around all night to play Catan! I really felt like I was part of the team at that point.</p>
			<h3>Day 3</h3>
			<p>Day three involved actually working on the styleguide. I started to learn <a href="https://github.com/tj/nib">nib</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kneath/kss">kss</a>, and learned how to document code as I went. It was really interesting to see how the work I was doing would actually be used. The styleguide used actual code rather than just a PDF so that the developers could just copy and paste the bits of code they needed for the various fonts and colors and paste them right into what they were working on.</p>
			<h3>Day 4</h3>
			<p>
				<div class="embed-container">
					<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/105656434?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="809" height="455" frameborder="0"></iframe>
				</div>
			</p>
			<p>On day four I kept working on the styleguide but also helped with bugfixes and typos in the Mix website and documentation. Day four was when everyone started ramping up the amount of work they were doing in order to get ready for the big presentation the next day.</p>
			<p>John worked a lot with me on day four after we all went for some bubble tea. He told me aboout his background at Microsoft and how he came to be at FiftyThree. He helped me understand the differences in design and how I should find the thread of design I was most passionate about. At the time I was interested in all sort, industrial, visual, interaction, etc. but what he said helped me decide that product design was for me. He also showed me the various iterations of tips they had gone through in making Pencil, they looked at various materials, forms, etc. They also had to consider all sort of other things such as form factor, cost, and how the electronics would fit. All these constraints had to be kept in mind in the development of Pencil, and showed me that design isn't really about being as creative as you can, that's art. Design is about being able to make something that is both useable and functional.</p><p>Somewhere along here it occured to me that design was a lot more about what the user thought, then what I, the designer, thought. The design interns that were at the Seattle office took the time to show me their portfolios and discuss where they were in college and the types of things they were doing. At the time I was putting together a list of colleges to apply to so University of Washington was added. Later that day Jon also took some time to talk to me about portfolios and various design schools that I should consider, this was really helpful becuase it showed me what I should be working towards.</p>
			<h3>Day 5</h3>	
			<p>The last day was about wrapping up for the week. It consisted of a big meeting between the entire team in the Seattle office and the entire team in the New York office. Everyone was given a chance to present what they had been working on that week (even me! though I didn't take the oppurutnity). This was especially cool because I was introduced to the other cofounders on the east coast and see people like <a href="https://twitter.com/kjchun">KJ</a> who had helped me on my path.</p>

			<h3>Shout Outs</h3>
			<p>I want to give a shout out to <a href="https://twitter.com/gasi">Daniel Gasienica</a> who was my mentor for the duration I was there. He's the one that helped me get all setup and explained really complex algorithm related questions in a way that I could understand. I also want to give a huge shout out to <a href="https://twitter.com/johnikeda">John Ikeda</a> who helped me understand the differences in the various forms of design, from industrial, to product, to visual, and how I should go about finding my passion. I also want to mention <a href="https://twitter.com/jon_creates">Jon Harris</a>, one of the co-founders of FiftyThree, who helped me understand what goes into a good design portfolio and how to tell the narrative of the design process. And lastly I also want to give a shout out to <a href="https://twitter.com/tfeener">Tara Feener</a> for first noticing me and my <a href="/archive/oldsite2/index.html">FiftyThree knockoff website</a> and giving me that follow that started the whole ball rolling. If it weren't for her none of this would've been able to happen.</p>
