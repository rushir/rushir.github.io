			<a href="/project/clerk/index.html" target="_blank">Clerk</a> was an idea to help monetize blogs through a micro-donation platform on a Feedly/Flipboard type app. This idea was actually a large project involving mentors and business plans and was even pitched to seed-stage funds and other investors. If you'd like to see a more detailed plan including advisors, revenue goals, feature lists etc. then click <a href="/resources/VisionforClerk.pdf" target="_blank">here.</a>

			</blockquote><p></p>
			<h3>Pitch</h3>
			<p>Clerk is a beautiful, minimal news reader that curates feeds so as to only show the best article on each piece of news, allows readers to follow specific writers as well as news sites, and acts as a conduit of high class, well-written articles to the user rather than just a stream of stubs and links to other sources. But Clerk is more than just a news reader; rather, Clerk is an entire publishing platform, a conversation platform.
			Clerk offers the ability to follow writers directly rather than just the companies they associate with. Clerk gives authors a means to be compensated for their work through their readers; if a reader enjoys an article, he/she can quickly reward the author with a small donation through CentUp, which is directly integrated with Clerk.
			Clerk removes the clutter so you can read.

			<p>We wanted the reading expereince to be delightful and therefore went in a direction that was simple and achieved a purpose, allowing the user to read.</p>
