			Startup Exchange is a club at Georgia Tech focused on providing students with resources and skills they can use to transform their ideas into tangible products. I joined Startup Exchange at the beginning of my first semester at Georgia Tech and was inspired by past members to commit myself more to the club. Since then I've worked to rebrand the Startup Exchange community through new branding materials and a new <a href="http://startupexchange.gatech.edu/">website</a>.</p>
			<img class="bodyimg" src="/resources/img/projects/startupexchange/01.jpg" alt="" align="middle"><p></p>
			<p>Using an image of what the new meeting place would look like as the background, I created a landing page with the new fonts and colors I selected that represent the Startup Exchange and Georgia Tech community.</p>
			<img class="bodyimg" src="/resources/img/projects/startupexchange/03.jpg" alt="" align="middle"><p></p>
			<p>For this poster I had the idea of using a color splash effect to identify the building Startup Exchange is located in. I matched this with Georgia Tech's "Old Gold" color for the header text. </p>
			<img class="bodyimg" src="/resources/img/projects/startupexchange/02.jpg" alt="" align="middle"><p></p>
			<p>With the second version of the poster I turned up the brightness to not make the atmosphere gloomy. Luckily the Atlanta skyline is very prominent from most angles on campus and therefore the buildings are identifiable. In this version I matched the building's color with the font pairing and turned up the saturation a little just to make the building stand out more.</p>
			<img class="bodyimg" src="/resources/img/projects/startupexchange/04.png" alt="" align="middle"><p></p>
			<p>Just for fun I created a wallpaper for the Startup Exchange community highlighting the key things that makes the community what it is. Georgia Tech is represented in the color scheme and the foreground, and the city of Atlanta which is home to the Atlanta Tech Village in the background, representing where our support comes from.</p>
