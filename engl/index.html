            <p>My passion is creating: making things that make people’s lives better, whether it be creating apps, robots, or services. I am not the best at what I do, but I will find the answer to any problem, no matter how long it takes. I spend my free time researching and prototyping, seeking out mentors and completing internships. I have grown up tuning out the unimportant. When I was little, I wouldn’t leave my room until I finished my LEGO masterpieces. The same is true today--I strive to complete. Similarly, I welcome failure (my clumsy hands broke a handful of my LEGO masterpieces while they were in the works), writing down what went wrong in my notes for my next project. The high school atmosphere can be monotonous: the same classes and schedule each day. At my school there is little room to grow outside of sports and traditional academic subjects. I’ve had to search for mentors and opportunities beyond what my school offers, to learn the unique skills that I need to accomplish my goals. Mark Twain said “I have never let my schooling interfere with my education.” His is an optimistic perspective that I apply to my daily life; I haven’t ever let anything get in the way of pursuing my dreams, and I never will.</p>

            <h1>Having the audacity to tweet Aza Raskin started a snowball of events in my life.</h1>
            <p>For as long as I can remember I’ve wanted to leave a lasting, meaningful impact on the world. Growing up without siblings and with a hardworking single mom gave me time to dream about my future, and I knew that I needed to prove to my mom that I could succeed because she risked everything for me. I would plan out “CIA missions” and act them out, going so far as to hire my friends as fellow agents, as we scaled trees and went spelunking.</p><p>During freshman year I met my first mentor, Aza Raskin, who taught me the importance of helping communities grow. Junior year I decided to give back to all the bloggers and news sites that had given me so much valuable information, so I created Clerk. Clerk was an idea for an app that would allow you to make small “micro” donations to the bloggers you like the most. Many people take running a blog for granted. Although bloggers may have revenue coming in from ads on their website, I felt that I should add to it.</p>

        <div class="workres">
            <p>Everyone wants to leave a positive impact on society, but few have experienced the satisfaction of creating something from scratch and having that product help hundreds of people. Although Clerk was never put out into the open, the idea reached hundreds of people who suggested improvements, features, and thanked me for creating it. Clerk was a vision for an easier future for bloggers where they wouldn’t worry about where their next paycheck would come from. Clerk was just the beginning. For me, building something isn’t just creating without purpose: it requires vision and planning. My vision is to lead the future intersection between global cultures and technology.</p></br>

            <p>My story is simple. Growing up without access to experts or creation studios has forced me to become my own expert and to seek out those things myself. I have identified the important goals in my life, such as creating a successful startup that I am actively pursuing, and with my persistence, I know that I will succeed.</p></br>

            <p>I’m addicted to building things. Many kids’ passion for making disappears by the time they are teenagers and outgrow their LEGO sets, but in the 6th grade I met my friend Vishant, who introduce me to The First LEGO League: a robotics competition using pieces to create robots to accomplish certain tasks. Once I started robotics I was hooked. That same year I applied for and was accepted into the inaugural class of a STEM-focused middle school called the da Vinci Academy, where I introduced my peers to the First LEGO League. Later that year we had our first competition, though we lost we learned a lot about the importance of teamwork and communication. It was here at the da Vinci Academy that I had my first introduction into the world of computers and robotics. My passion for technology grew, and I soon started teaching myself about programming and UI/UX design. Since then I’ve acquired a team of mentors who have coached me through becoming a problem-solving UX designer, an entrepreneur, and a forward thinker. I’ve also completed various internships: my first was with my mentor Aza Raskin at his startup Massive Health. Here I worked with UI design as I was only starting to understand the powers of Photoshop. My next internship was with BestFit Mobile, where I did web and app design. My favorite project was creating an interface for doctors to share patient information with other doctors in the same network. In the summer of 2013 I had the opportunity to visit the Silicon Valley where I toured Mozilla, Google, and Jawbone. Here I was inspired to broaden my interests beyond merely designing for apps, and I began focus on creating services for the future of technology in relation to the changing world.</p></br>

            <p>So what? I want to be a leader in technological entrepreneurship. I want to make technology easier to use and easier to access. Often times, those whose stories need to be heard the most, have no way of communicating it to a global audience. I want to provide them the tools to do just that so that we as people can learn from others’ struggles.</p>
