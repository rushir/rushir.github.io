            <p>Back in 8th grade I kinda had a thing for you, it was funny because the other Rachel though it was her, but of course Michael and Juan made sure you knew that it was you. And then there was Adrianna who basically instructed me on how to dress if I wanted to impress you. I think that's when I started wearing button-downs.</p><p>I'm not really sure if it was a mistake not asking you back then because then this might not be happening... and of course we couldn't have done anything then either, probably the most would have been going to Chick-Fil-A or something. But now we can do so much more: dinners, movies... proms... Let me know what you think because I think it would be pretty darn swell.</p>
