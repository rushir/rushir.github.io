            <h1>Building something isn’t just creating without purpose: it requires vision and planning.</h1>
            <p>My passion is creating: making things that make people’s lives better. I have grown up tuning out the unimportant. When I was little, I wouldn’t leave my room until I finished my LEGO masterpieces. The same is true today--I strive to complete.At my high school there is little room to grow outside of sports and traditional academic subjects.</p><p>I’ve had to search for mentors and opportunities beyond what my school offers, to learn the unique skills that I need to accomplish my goals. Mark Twain said “I have never let my schooling interfere with my education.” His is an optimistic perspective that I apply to my daily life; I haven’t ever let anything get in the way of pursuing my dreams, and I never will.</p>
