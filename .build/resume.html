            <p>This coming fall I hope to learn the fundamentals of interaction design. I will also be participating in numerous hackathons, startup events, and internships. I then intend to further specialize into interaction design by taking additional computer science courses which will allow me to be at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJU8au3bKIA">top of my game</a> when I go to work as a Product Designer.</p>
