        <p>My passion is creating: making things that make people’s lives better, whether it be creating apps, robots, or services. I am not the best at what I do, but I will find the answer to any problem, no matter how long it takes. I spend my free time researching and prototyping, seeking out mentors and completing internships. I have grown up tuning out the unimportant. When I was little, I wouldn’t leave my room until I finished my LEGO masterpieces. The same is true today--I strive to complete. Similarly, I welcome failure (my clumsy hands broke a handful of my LEGO masterpieces while they were in the works), writing down what went wrong in my notes for my next project. The high school atmosphere can be monotonous: the same classes and schedule each day. At my school there is little room to grow outside of sports and traditional academic subjects. I’ve had to search for mentors and opportunities beyond what my school offers, to learn the unique skills that I need to accomplish my goals. Mark Twain said “I have never let my schooling interfere with my education.” His is an optimistic perspective that I apply to my daily life; I haven’t ever let anything get in the way of pursuing my dreams, and I never will.</p>

        <p>My mom tells me stories of growing up in India, the rigorous coursework and demanding schedule that she endured, and the endless hours of studying she needed to do every night. She says that I am lucky to be born in America, surrounded by opportunity, but I feel like it’s even harder here. In America I have opportunity, but it seems limitless: an endless amount of choices. In India my choices would be limited, and I’d be unable to backtrack and go through another door.</p>

        <p>For as long as I can remember I’ve wanted to leave a lasting, meaningful impact on the world. Growing up without siblings and with a hardworking single mom gave me time to dream about my future, and I knew that I needed to prove to my mom that I could succeed because she risked everything for me. I would plan out “CIA missions” and act them out, going so far as to hire my friends as fellow agents, as we scaled trees and went spelunking.</p>

        <p>During freshman year I met my first mentor, Aza Raskin, who taught me the importance of helping communities grow. Junior year I decided to give back to all the bloggers and news sites that had given me so much valuable information, so I created Clerk. Clerk was an idea for an app that would allow you to make small “micro” donations to the bloggers you like the most. Many people take running a blog for granted. Although bloggers may have revenue coming in from ads on their website, I felt that I should add to it.</p>

        <p>Everyone wants to leave a positive impact on society, but few have experienced the satisfaction of creating something from scratch and having that product help hundreds of people. Although Clerk was never put out into the open, the idea reached hundreds of people who suggested improvements, features, and thanked me for creating it. Clerk was a vision for an easier future for bloggers where they wouldn’t worry about where their next paycheck would come from. Clerk was just the beginning. For me, building something isn’t just creating without purpose: it requires vision and planning. My vision is to lead the future intersection between global cultures and technology.</p>

        <p>My story is simple. Growing up without access to experts or creation studios has forced me to become my own expert and to seek out those things myself. I have identified the important goals in my life, such as creating a successful startup that I am actively pursuing, and with my persistence, I know that I will succeed.</p>

It was initially meant to be a project with a limited production of 50 bikes, but Alta soon got so popular that it became the first serial production single speed bike on the marked. The idea behind the Alta Bike was to make a light, timeless, fast and durable bicycle that was designed for city use.</p><p>

The Alta Bike has been bought by the Norwegian National Museum as a part of their permanent collection. Already stated a "Design Classic", Alta has gained a lot of international press and even been blatantly copied by a Japanese, an Australian and an American bike brand.</p><p>Get your own at www.altabikes.no</p></span>

                    <span class="workcontent"><p>Riksteatret is Norway´s national touring theatre. The brief aimed at renewing and repositioning the brand to increase the theatre´s audience among culture enthusiasts across the whole of Norway.</p>

<p>Since theatre is still perceived as somewhat "elitist" among the general public, our solution aimed at negating this misconception and creating a more direct expression which could also communicate to the younger generation. The result manifests itself in a renewed brand that appears contemporary and ambitious yet does not sacrifice a visible long history.</p>

<p>The visual concept for the Riksteatret identity is derived from the usage of bulletin boards — a timeless provider of information, as relevant today as it was a hundred years ago.</p>

<p>The logo, which is ispired by a poster is built upon a flexible rectangular format. The four outer corners (where the poster was once held by nails) are suspended by a thick frame as well as the letters "R,I,K,S" (meaning "national" in norwegian).</p>

<p>This system adapts to the corresponding medium and format seamlessly, thus creating a differentiating and instantly recognizable visual expression. This dynamic framework allows room for different and versatile expressions per production, depending on the communicative intention.</p></span>
